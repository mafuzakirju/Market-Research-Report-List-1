<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TCR-T Cellular Immunotherapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autologous</li><li>Allogeneic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TCR-T cellular immunotherapy involves redirecting T cells to target specific cancer antigens. The market is primarily divided into two types: autologous and allogeneic therapies. Autologous therapies utilize a patientâ€™s own T cells, offering personalized treatment but requiring complex manufacturing processes. In contrast, allogeneic therapies involve T cells from healthy donors, allowing for off-the-shelf applications and potentially wider accessibility. Both approaches aim to enhance anti-tumor responses but differ in production timelines and patient-specific customization.</p></p>
