<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pulmonary Surfactant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synthetic Pulmonary Surfactants</li><li>Animal Derived Surfactants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pulmonary surfactant market is divided into two main types: synthetic pulmonary surfactants and animal-derived surfactants. Synthetic surfactants are artificially created formulations designed to mimic natural surfactants, offering advantages such as consistency and decreased risk of infection. In contrast, animal-derived surfactants are extracted from natural sources, typically porcine or bovine lungs, and retain the complex composition of native surfactants, which may enhance their effectiveness in clinical applications. Both types are crucial for treating respiratory conditions like neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.</p></p>
