<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Military Access Control Solutions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Discretionary Access Control</li><li>Mandatory Access Control</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Military access control solutions are crucial for securing sensitive information and facilities. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) allows users to control access to their resources, permitting permissions at their discretion, which is flexible but can be less secure. Conversely, Mandatory Access Control (MAC) enforces strict policy-based security, restricting users' ability to modify access rights, enhancing security through centralized control. Both types play vital roles in safeguarding military operations by balancing user autonomy and stringent security measures.</p></p>
